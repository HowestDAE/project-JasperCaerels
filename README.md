# The grand exchange, game design with economics inbetween!
## Introduction
Most MMORPGs have one same component, a player driven economy, Runescape is no different!
Since 2007-2008 their own personal system called the Grand Exchange was introduced.
The Grand Exchange is a place where players can come together to socialize,
manage their banks or trade items with fluctuating prices.

This project will recreate the G.E. (Grand Exchange) item API and portray a simpler version of it usable to check
prices of items, if it dropped or raised in price. Each item will be filtered through category and then once more with 1st letter of its name.

## Motivation
Besides the game aspect of this MMORPG, I'm also very interested in game driven economics, stocks and cryptocurrency.
In addition I've been playing Runescape since 2006 and aside from VR development, Jagex would be one of my dream companies to work at.
Even tho the work I'd want to manage there would be more C++ game engine based, it's still interesting to  work with their JSON API.
